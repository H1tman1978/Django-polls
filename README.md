<h1>Django-polls</h1>

This is my first Django app that I created following the Django docs tutorial. As such, I really can't say no you can do whatever your heart desires with this code so it's on a GNU 3.0 license. I'm a noob with Django, so please feel free to let me know of any issues you discover by sending me an <a href="mailto:anthony@anthonyrolfe.rocks">email</a>. Enjoy!!

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

I'm assuming you're also a python developer and you know how to use python in the terminal and pip too. There's two ways to go about installing this web app:

<h3>First Method:</h3>

Clone this repository and then just copy and paste the polls folder into your django framework and follow the instructions in the README.rst file

<h3>Second Method:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Head on over to the Dist folder and right click on the tar.gz file and choose "Save As" from the menu.</li>
    <li>Open a command promp or terminal in the directory you saved the file.</li>
    <li>type this into your prompt: <strong>pip install --user django-polls/dist/django-polls-0.1.tar.gz</strong></li>
    <li>You should now be able to import this package in your programming files</li>
</ol>

<h4>I'm sure you all knew how to do this, but I thought instructions are a nice to have. I hope you enjoy this app and be sure to check back to see more future apps. Happy Programming!</h4>
